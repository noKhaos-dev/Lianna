                            Working with Lianna has been incredibly valuable for my business. She helped open my eyes to areas that needed attention that I honestly hadn't fully seen before, and brought a new level of organization and clarity to everything I was juggling. Her ability to help me plan ahead, structure my workflow, and look at things from a different perspective made a real impact. She's thoughtful, proactive, and truly operates like an extension of the business rather than just support.
